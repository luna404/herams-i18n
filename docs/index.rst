.. Warning:: Deleting records cannot be undone. Be careful when deleting a record.


Download Data
=============

Data for individual health facilities can be downloaded as **CSV** or **Excel** file. 

.. note:: Whether you have access to download data depends on your function and role. If you require your access permissions to be changed, kindly contact your country focal point or send an email to `herams@who.int <mailto:herams@who.int?>`_ specifying your function and role as well as a brief explanation on why you would like your access permissions to altered.

Download Workspace Data
-----------------------

Follow the instructions below to download data for your workspace. If you require data from multiple workspaces, you can repeat the below steps and merge your data in an analysis tool of choice.

.. note:: In order to download data, you will require special permissions to the workspace. Contact your system administrator to elevate your access rights if needed.


1. Navigate to the workspace page of your project (see `Access your workspace`_ steps 1 - 4 for detailed instructions).
2. In the rightmost column, click the |download| icon. This will open a new page, allowing you to customize your export.
3. The survey settings enabling you to tailor the export to your needs. You can chose between exporting data as text or code as well as the type of header to be included in your export. Use the on/off switches to modify the default options.

.. note:: If you choose to export answers as code, question with predefined answer option will show coded value (e.g. A1) instead of the text label.  

4. If a survey is available in multiple language, use the drop-down list to specify the export language. 
5. By default, only the most recent response for each health facility is exported. For projects with multiple records per health facility, the data exported can be further customized in the Advanced settings. 
	- **Export all records**: To export all historic records of a health facility, leave the **Report date** filed blank. 
	- **Export one record per Health facility**: If a report date is defined,  only the last record before or equal to the selected date will be exported for each health facility. To get the most recent data, set the **Report date** equal to today.
6. Once you have defined the export settings, select between the two export formats (**CSV** or **Excel**) by clicking the respective button. 

.. note:: For large data sets, exporting data in Excel takes substantially longer than exporting as **CSV** format.  

.. tip:: To avoid encoding issues, it is recommended that you download your data as Excel file if you select a language other than English. For more information of encoding of **CSV** files for use in Excel, see  `Data Encoding in Excel`_ .

Download the Entire Data Set
----------------------------
Project administrators or users with special permissions can export the entire project data from the admin interface. 

.. note:: Access to project level data is limited to selected users only. Contact your country administrator for further information.

1. Open the admin interface by clicking the |settings| icon in the top right corner of the screen.
2. In the navigation pane on the left, click `Projects <https://herams.org/project/index>`__ . This will open a overview table of all ongoing **Projects** in HeRAMS. 
3. In the rightmost column of the table, you should see several **Action** buttons. Click the |download| icon. This will open  the download settings. 
4. You should now be able to customize your export as outlined in the previous section `here <#download-workspace-data>`__.

Data Encoding in Excel
----------------------
If data is downloaded for further analysis in Excel or a statistical software of choice (e.g. R or STATA), data encoding should always be set to UTF-8. 

.. tip:: Encoding issues are particularly prevalent in languages with special character and can result in the data being unreadable. For example, instead of **camp de réfugiés** you get **Camp de rÃ©fugiÃ©s**.

.. tip:: To avoid encoding issues, it is recommended that you download your data as an **Excel** file. 

The below instructions guide users through the steps to define the data encoding in Excel. 

1. Open a new Excel file.
2. On the Data tab in the **Get & Transform Data** group, click **From Text/CSV**.
3. In the **Import Data** dialog box, locate and double-click the text file that you want to import, and click **Import**.
4. In the top left corner of the pop-up window that opens, change the encoding type to **UTF-8**, and click **Import**.

HeRAMS Administration
=====================

This chapter provides an overview of the admin pages in HeRAMS and offers step-by-step instructions for common tasks performed by advanced users (e.g. *Workspace Owners* and *Project Admins*. The first part of the chapter focuses on user management. It provides an overview of the default HeRAMS **User roles** used through the platform followed by detailed description on how to add users to workspaces and projects. The remaining parts of this chapter focuses on more advanced topics and are intended to guide *Project Admins* on how to administer a project locally. 


.. note:: Access to different parts of the admin interface depend on your function and role. If you require your permissions to be changed, kindly contact your *Project Admin* or send an email to `HeRAMS Support Team <mailto:herams@who.int?>`_ specifying your function and role as well as a brief explanation of why you would like your access permissions to altered.

User Management
---------------

Workspace Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Granting a users permission to a workspace enables them to contribute or download data, as well as as to manage user access to their workspace. There are four permissions for workspaces that can be assigned independently:

**Edit data**: Allows user to create, edit and delete records.

**Download data** Enables users to download all records from a workspace for further analysis in external applications. 

**Manage users**: Permits users to share access to a workspace with other users.

**Grant admin permissions**: This permission is only available to *Project administrators* and should only be granted to *Workspace owners* responsible for managing a workspace. By granting a user admin permission to a workspace, the user will be able to grant other users permission to share access to the workspace. Thus, this permission should be used very carefully. 

  .. Note: The permission a user can share are depending on a users own permissions. Thus, it is possible that a user with the permission to 

**Manage users** is not able to grant access to edit data. 

Workspace permission should always be assigned in with regard to the a users roles. The below screenshots indicate the level of permissions that should be granted to the respective user. 
For further details on the standard HeRAMS user roles, please consult the `previous section <#user-roles>`__.


Project Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to workspace permissions, permissions can also be granted at the project level. It is important to notice that if permissions are granted at the *Project level*, users are being granted access to all workspaces. For example, if a user is granted *Edit* permission at the *Project level*, they can edit data for all workspace. In contrast, if a user is granted access at the *Workspace level*, they are only able to contribute data to that specific workspace.

There are five permissions that can be granted at the project level.

**View dashboard**: Grants access exclusively to the *Project Dashboard*. Granting users explicit access to the *Project Dashboard* is only required for *Closed* or *Private* projects. For all other projects, any user subscribed to the platform will be able to view the *Project Dashboard*. 

**Edit data**: Allows user to create, edit and delete records in any workspace of the project. 

**Download data**: Enables users to download  the entire dateset, including records from all workspace for further analysis in external applications. 

**Manage workspaces** grants a user access to create, modify and delete workspaces as well as the ability to invite users to contribute to individual worksapace. 

.. Warning: *Workspace Owners* must be granted permission at the workspace level. If a user is granted permissions to *Manage workspaces* they will have access to **all** workspaces.

**Configure dashboard**: grants users the ability to edit and configure their *Project Dashboard*. 


HeRAMS User Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There six standard roles that are used accross HeRAMS projects. 

  .. image:: media/img/HeRAMS_user_roles.png
	:height: 200px
	:alt: user roles
	:align: center
	

**Project Owner**: Designated person who is responsible for the HeRAMS project. They can invite users to view the project dashboard or the list of available workspaces but are not expected to conduct the daily activities of managing users and assuring data quality.

**Project Admin**: The *Project Owner* typically relies on an Information Management Officer to manage the daily activities of the HeRAMS Project and assigns them the role of *Project Admin*. The *Project Admin* has access to all workspaces. Depending on the project setup, they might also be assigned to configure the project dashboard. While *Project Admins* are responsible for the overall training and management of users, they can assign *Workspace Owners* to manage individual workspaces.

**Workspace Owner:** are commonly at the sub-national level, overseeing data collection for a specific area (e.g. a district). They have full control over their workspace and can invite other users to contribute to their workspace. It is important to notice that *Workspace Owners* can only edit or share access to the workspaces they own. However, like any user having been granted access to a project, they can explore data from other workspaces using the project dashboard.

**Data Contributor:** Support the workspace owner in collecting and managing information on individual health facilities. Alike *Workspace Owners* they can only edit data within their workspace but are able to view the overall project by accessing the project dashboard.

**Data Viewers**: In exceptional situations, a user might be granted role of *Data Viewer*. This means they are granted access to download the workspace data but are unable to edit data. Alike all users having been granted access to a project, they are also able to access the project dashboard. 

**Project Viewer:** The role of *Project Viewer* is intended for users at any level who rely on HeRAMS data for their own work. Their access is limited to the project dashboard and the list of available workspace.

.. Note: If a project is set to **Private** or **Closed** access to the project dashboard can be further restricted. Please consult `Project Settings` for further information on project statuses. 


Mapping User Roles to Permissions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**Data contributors**: *Data Contributors* are granted access to *Edit Data* for individual workspaces.

  .. image:: media/img/HeRAMS_permissions_data_contributor1.png
	:height: 200px
	:alt: share workspace
	:align: center
	
Optionally, *Data Contributors* can also be granted permissions to download data.

  .. image:: media/img/HeRAMS_permissions_data_contributor2.png
	:height: 200px
	:alt: share workspace
	:align: center

**Data Viewers**: t is possible to grant a users access to download data without providing them with edit rights. While this permission is commonly combined with access to *Edit Data*, under special circumstances, access might be granted to download data only. 

  .. image:: media/img/HeRAMS_permissions_data_viewer.png
	:height: 200px
	:alt: share workspace
	:align: center

**Workspace Owners**: In addition to editing and downloading data, *Workspace Owner* are granted the permission to *Manage Users*. This grants them the ability to invite other users to contribute to their workspace.

  .. image:: media/img/HeRAMS_permissions_workspace_owner.png
	:height: 200px
	:alt: share workspace
	:align: center

Under special circumstance a *Project Admin* might grant a *Workspace Owner* admin permission to a workspace, allowing the *Workspace Owner* to delegate managing user access for their workspace. This permission should be used carefully and only granted if absolutely necessary. 

  .. image:: media/img/HeRAMS_permissions_workspace_owner2,png
	:height: 200px
	:alt: share workspace
	:align: center
	
.. Warning: While a *Workspace Owner* may delegate granting access permissions to another user, they remain responsible for their workspace and users having access to it.

View a project/dashboard
------------------------

Can't access a project dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For data protection reasons, access to the project dashboards is only granted upon request. If you require access to a project, please contact your country focal point or send an email to `hearms@who.int <mailto:herams@who.int?>`_, specifying why you require access to the project.

Who has access to your project?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In-country administrators and users responsible for a project or workspace can verify the list of users having access to the
project and/or workspace as well as their permission levels.
See `HeRAMS Administration`_ for more information on sharing `Projects`_ and `Workspaces`_.

Data editing & downloading
--------------------------

Data updates don't appear on the dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is important to note that the data displayed on the interactive dashboards are only synchronized every 30 minutes. Thus, is it is possible that updates to the data don't show immediately on the dashboards. To solve the issue, manually sync the data cache of the workspace. For more information on data caching read the section on `Workspaces`_.
 
Exported data is unreadable / contains strange characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you open data downloaded from HeRAMS in Excel, you might experience an issue with special characters not displaying correctly, resulting in unreadable text. For example, instead of **camp de réfugiés** you get **Camp de rÃ©fugiÃ©s**. The reason for this is that Excel is not using the correct encoding type to read your data. To correct the issue, follow the instruction outlined `here <#data-encoding-in-excel>`__.
